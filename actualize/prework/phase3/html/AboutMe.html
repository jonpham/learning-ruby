<!-- 
Using JSFiddle, create a brand new webpage to create an About Me page. An About Me page should be about you, and is commonly found on blogs. Use as many HTML elements as you can get your hands on, including three new elements that I have not mentioned in any of the screencasts. Then, go crazy with CSS and dazzle up your page as if it were 1996. You'll probably have to do a decent amount of Googling, but one really useful site for learning HTML and CSS is W3 schools: http://www.w3schools.com.

Exercise:

Save your JSFiddle exercise and post the link below.

After completing this, you may be wondering how to include CSS into your local HTML files. There are several different ways to do this, and Rails takes a different approach than all those ways, so I haven't bothered dealing with this in these screencasts. But if you'd like to do this anyway, see this page to get started: (http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp)

			<small>I</small> am an engineer with a primary interest in software, computer science, cloud / web computing products and associated technologies. If you've seen my education history, you may have noticed I have two degrees that aren't really related to computer science. For reasons that even I don't know I did a weird transition in college from Electrical Engineering / Computer Science to Biomedical Engineering to Neuroscience, which I then followed up with a Masters in biomedical engineering. Though these were the official paths of study I took, I had always maintained some sort relationship with technologies as indicated by my primary fields of research,  in my undergraduate years this was on the utilization of computer vision to determine better statistical data from animal behavior tests and later on for my research thesis I did work with medical device imaging algorithms for blood flow mapping.  

			In 2012, I was given the opportunity to take a software engineering position at a Defense company. While I have enjoyed the opportunity, the methodologies, technologies, and practices employed are out-of-date from a software perspective. The company inherently designs combat vehicle systems and thus takes a very long cycle systems engineering approach to its product development. And while I have tried my best to elevate and improve efficiencies with current standards of software development within the software groups, I have been mostly met by apathy, disinterest, or resistance to anything which strays from legacy practices. 

			Still, in the absence of a hard order to stop trying to rock the boat, I've developed a lot of skills across the software product development cycle with wearing many hats as a Software  Developer / Tester (QA) / Project Manager (Agile Engineering PM) / Release Engineer / Operations (VCS, Continuous Integration, Testing and Deployment).  I'm hoping to make a change to a new company that produces software products and has a culture committed to continuous software improvement.
