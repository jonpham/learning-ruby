<!-- 
Using JSFiddle, create a brand new webpage to create an About Me page. An About Me page should be about you, and is commonly found on blogs. Use as many HTML elements as you can get your hands on, including three new elements that I have not mentioned in any of the screencasts. Then, go crazy with CSS and dazzle up your page as if it were 1996. You'll probably have to do a decent amount of Googling, but one really useful site for learning HTML and CSS is W3 schools: http://www.w3schools.com.

Exercise:

Save your JSFiddle exercise and post the link below.

After completing this, you may be wondering how to include CSS into your local HTML files. There are several different ways to do this, and Rails takes a different approach than all those ways, so I haven't bothered dealing with this in these screencasts. But if you'd like to do this anyway, see this page to get started: (http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp)

	    About me or what I believe in. I'd usually like to show not tell, but I don't have enough stuff yet. So you get a little story to explain who I am and why I'm <b>AmahZing</b>.

	  <p>
	    This page is a little bit about me, what I do, and how I do it. Maybe try to duplicate LinkedIn / Resume.
	    <br>
	    Discuss your education and how you've oriented outside of your degree, but how you've always
	    kept in touch with your interests.
